## To run mongodb on your system you need to install it from [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-ubuntu/)

### If you are facing issue like `connection refused` try putting sudo before mongo i.e `sudo mongo`
* If still you get some error then [this](https://askubuntu.com/questions/921753/failed-to-start-mongod-service-unit-mongod-service-not-found) might help. :rocket:
